ReadCleaner4Scaffolding


Description:
  This pipeline and the included scripts are used to filter useful reads for SSPACE
    1. Remove duplicates
    2. Remove high-depth reads (needs to define threshold)
           Please refer to SOPRA to defined your data-specific cut-off threshold
    3. Apply Window size for a group of reads to remove low-confidence reads and contigs

Main script: readCleaner4Scaffolding.sh.
    Options:
      -h    Print this help message
      -1    Fastq R1 files
      -2    Fastq R2 files
      -l    Libraries names
      -x    Bowtie index
      -r    Reference fasta
      -e    Maximum depth threshold;
      -m    Maximum insert size between mates for bowtie -X, default: 300
      -p    Output file prefix, without path
      -d    Delete temporary files
      -t    Number of threads, default: 1
      -sspace path to SSPACE

  First Part: Get mapped reads, deduplication and clean

    $ readCleaner4Scaffolding.sh -1 lib1.R1.fastq,lib2.R1.fastq -2 lib1.R2.fastq,lib2.R2.fastq -l lib1,lib2 -x bowtie.index -f reference.fasta-p out_prefix -d -t 5

    Will do: 
    1. bowtie_dedup_mates_separately.sh for each library
        Mapping each mate (-1 or -2) to reference (-r / -x)
        Merge both mates
        picardrmdup remove duplicates
        Merge libaries
    2. picardrmdup again
    3. SAMtools depth calculate average depth and STDEV
        You need to define depth threshold to remove reads in repeat region
          Note: picardrmdup will deduplicate each mate separately,
                so, some reads may have two duplicates

  Second Part: Run with -e option: extract reads, remap, and deduplicate

$ readCleaner4Scaffolding.sh -1 lib1.R1.fastq,lib2.R1.fastq -2 lib1.R2.fastq,lib2.R2.fastq -l lib1,lib2 -x bowtie.index -f reference.fasta-p out_prefix -d -t 5 -e 5

    Will do
    4. Remove high-depth reads
    5. Extract non-high-depth reads
    6. Bowtie mapping
    7. Clean high depth again
        Keep both mate mapped reads
    8. Extract reads again [1]
        Bowtie map as mate
        rmdup
        Get read names with FLAG 1024
        Exclude these reads from [1]
            * For further analysis
        bowtie map as single again
            * For further analysis
        merge BAMs
            * For further analysis
    9. Extract reads and reference seq for SSPACE
    10. run SSPACE
