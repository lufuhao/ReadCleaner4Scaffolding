  This pipeline and the included scripts are used to filter useful reads for SSPACE
    1. Remove duplicates
    2. Remove high-depth reads (needs to define threshold)
           Please refer to SOPRA to defined your data-specific cut-off threshold
    3. Apply Window size for a group of reads to remove low-confidence reads and contigs
